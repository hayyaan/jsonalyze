# jsonalyze

Tool to do basic analysis on JSON files. Planned features include:
- Determine object types for properties, especially arrays
- Cardinality report on values against their keys, for array objects
- Ability to view all values for a key (sorted by frequency?)
- Validation (see: jsonlint)

Planned browser extension, possibly website to run this as a service
